                    Certain areas of the Website may require registration. The decision to register is purely optional; however, if you
                    elect not to register, you may not be able to use all or a portion of the Website. When you provide information to the
                    Website, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. If you provide any information that
                    is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is
                    untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and
                    all current or future use of the Website (or any portion thereof).
                    <br><br>
                    If you register on the Website and/or create an account or personal profile, you agree to accept responsibility for all
                    activities that occur under your account ("Account") or password, if any, and you agree you will not sell, transfer or
                    assign your membership or any membership rights to your Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
                    of your password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer (or other internet access device, as applicable)
                    so that others may not access the password protected portion of the Website using your name in whole or in part. We
                    reserve the right to terminate your Account or otherwise deny you access in its sole discretion without notice and
                    without liability.
                    <br><br>
                    Subject to compliance with these Terms, for a limited time, the Website is granting its users a free, non-exclusive
                    license together with the authority to use the Website, its services, and technology (collectively, the "Technology").
                    We reserve the right to charge fees for using the Technology in the future. If we ever decide to charge fees to use the
                    Website, registered users would be notified of the fees in advance and would be given the opportunity to decline
                    continuing use before fees were charged. You will not be charged a fee by us without your prior express consent.

                    You understand and agree that the Website is provided "as-is" and that we assume no responsibility for the timeliness,
                    deletion, mis-delivery, or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings, if any. You may not (i)
                    copy, modify, redistribute, sell, sublicense, assign, or transfer, any Technology, (ii) copy or adapt the source or
                    object code of the Website's software, HTML, JavaScript or other programming code, or (iii) reverse engineer, decompile,
                    reverse assemble, modify or attempt to discover any source code that the Website creates to generate web pages or any
                    software or other products or processes accessible through the Website.
                    <br><br>
                    You also agree that you will not (i) use any robot, spider, rover, scraper, or any other data mining technology or
                    automatic or manual process to monitor, cache, frame, mask, extract data from, copy or distribute the Technology (except
                    as may be a result of standard Internet browser or search engine), (ii) fail to follow the instructions provided on the
                    Website in a "robots.txt" file or similar mechanism (to the extent that you provide standard search engine services to
                    the public), nor (iii) modify, frame, reproduce, archive, sell, lease, rent, exchange, create derivative works from,
                    publish by hard copy or electronic means, publicly perform, display, disseminate, distribute, broadcast, retransmit,

                    commercial purpose except as specifically permitted by these Terms or us without our prior written consent.

                    registration is void where prohibited by applicable law, and the right to access the Website is revoked in such
                    jurisdictions. By using the Website and/or the services, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority,
