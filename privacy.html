            (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with
            services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate
            business interests. <br>
            <br><br>
            If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
            <br><br>
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in
            order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal
            information: <br>
            Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal
            information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your
            consent. <br>
            Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal
            obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights,
            or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
            Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the
            vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
            <br><br>
            If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
            <br><br>
            We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal
            information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You
            can withdraw your consent at any time.
            <br><br>
            In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your
            consent, including, for example: <br>
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
            For investigations and fraud detection and prevention <br>
            For business transactions provided certain conditions are met <br>
            If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance
            claim <br>
            For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
            If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
            information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
            contravention of the laws of Canada or a province <br>
            If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
            production of records <br>
            If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is
            consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
            If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
            If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>

            How to Exercise Your Rights <br>
            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data subject access request, by emailing us at
            support@dynat3k.com, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. <br>
            <br><br>
            Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We
            may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on
            your behalf in accordance with applicable laws. <br>
            Request Verification <br>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we
            have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
            identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
            maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and
            for security or fraud-prevention purposes. <br>
            <br><br>
            If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your
            identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to
            submit such request on your behalf. <br>
            Appeals <br>
            Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our
            decision by emailing us at support@dynat3k.com. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in
            response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you
            may submit a complaint to your state attorney general. <br>
            California "Shine The Light" Law <br>
            California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California
            residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
            information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
            third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
            California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us by using the
            contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</p>
